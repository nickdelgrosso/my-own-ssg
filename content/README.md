## Content Files

This is where your content goes!  Content can be in any form, but for now I've only put in support for Markdown files that have yaml headers for metadata (seperated by three dashes).  These files are rendered by the correspondingly-named template files in your site's theme.  Take a look at the example files here to get an idea about thow they work.

Currently, metadata is arbitrary; there isn't anything needed by the SSG system in order to render the content.  However, it's a good idea to make sure that the same metadata is present in all similarly-rendered files (in the example data here, all the page/xx.md files have the same metadata).
